# Fortunes Project - Architectural Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architectural refactoring performed on the Fortunes project to improve maintainability, testability, and extensibility. The refactoring addresses fundamental issues with the original architecture while preserving all existing functionality.

## Problems with Original Architecture

### 1. **Global Singleton Anti-Pattern**
- **Issue**: Heavy reliance on global singletons (`GM`, `Stats`, `Events`)
- **Problems**: 
  - Tight coupling between components
  - Difficult to test (can't mock dependencies)
  - Hard to reason about data flow
  - Global state makes debugging complex

### 2. **Loose Data Structures**
- **Issue**: Extensive use of loose dictionaries and untyped data
- **Problems**:
  - No compile-time type safety
  - Runtime errors from typos or missing keys
  - Poor IDE support and code completion
  - Difficult to track data flow

### 3. **Monolithic Stats System**
- **Issue**: Single massive `Stats.gd` file with hundreds of variables
- **Problems**:
  - Hard to maintain and understand
  - No logical grouping of related data
  - Difficult to add new stats without cluttering
  - Poor encapsulation

### 4. **Scattered Configuration**
- **Issue**: Game constants and defaults scattered throughout codebase
- **Problems**:
  - Hard to balance and modify values
  - No central validation
  - Difficult to support modding
  - Inconsistent default values

### 5. **Complex Event System**
- **Issue**: Global event system with unclear categorization
- **Problems**:
  - Events mixed together without clear purpose
  - Difficult to track event flow
  - No type safety for event parameters
  - Hard to debug event chains

## New Architecture Solutions

### 1. **Dependency Injection System**

**Replaced**: Global singletons with proper dependency injection

**New Structure**:
```gdscript
# Core game state management
class GameState:
    var deck_manager: DeckManager
    var card_calculator: CardCalculator
    var upgrade_manager: UpgradeManager
    var save_manager: SaveManager
    var audio_manager: AudioManager
    var stats: GameStats
    var event_bus: EventBus
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear dependency relationships
- Easy to mock for testing
- Explicit data flow
- Better error handling

### 2. **Strongly Typed Data Structures**

**Replaced**: Loose dictionaries with proper classes

**New Structure**:
```gdscript
# Type-safe card data
class Card:
    var id: int
    var suit: SuitType
    var value: int
    var is_unlocked: bool
    var is_flipped: bool

# Structured calculation results
class CardCalculationResult:
    var base_value: int
    var modified_value: int
    var final_value: int
    var clairvoyance_change: int
    var effects_applied: Array[String]
```

**Benefits**:
- Compile-time type safety
- Better IDE support
- Clear data contracts
- Reduced runtime errors

### 3. **Organized Stats System**

**Replaced**: Monolithic Stats class with organized subclasses

**New Structure**:
```gdscript
class GameStats:
    var clairvoyance: int
    var packs: int
    var cup_stats: CupStats
    var wand_stats: WandStats
    var pentacle_stats: PentacleStats
    var sword_stats: SwordStats
    var major_stats: MajorStats

class CupStats:
    var basic_value: int
    var basic_quantity: int
    var vessel_quantity: int
    var vessel_size: int
    # ... etc
```

**Benefits**:
- Logical grouping of related data
- Better encapsulation
- Easier to maintain
- Clear data relationships

### 4. **Configuration System**

**Replaced**: Scattered constants with centralized configuration

**New Structure**:
```gdscript
class GameConfig:
    const DEFAULT_CLAIRVOYANCE = 0
    const DEFAULT_MAX_DECK_SIZE = 56
    const VALID_CURRENCY_RANGE = Vector2(-999999, 999999)
    
    func validate_stat(stat_name: String, value: Variant) -> bool
    func get_default_value(stat_name: String) -> Variant
```

**Benefits**:
- Centralized game balance
- Built-in validation
- Easy modding support
- Consistent defaults

### 5. **Improved Event System**

**Replaced**: Global events with categorized event bus

**New Structure**:
```gdscript
class EventBus:
    # Game lifecycle events
    signal game_initialized
    signal game_loaded
    signal game_reset(reset_type: ResetType)
    
    # Card events
    signal card_drawn(card: Card, flipped: bool)
    signal card_calculated(card: Card, result: CardCalculationResult)
    
    # UI events
    signal currency_updated(amount: int, currency_type: CurrencyType)
    signal tooltip_requested(tooltip_data: TooltipData)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear event categorization
- Type-safe event parameters
- Better debugging support
- Explicit event flow
